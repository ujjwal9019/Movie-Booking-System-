ApplicationConfig Class
The ApplicationConfig class configures Spring Security components and provides the necessary beans for authentication and user management:

userDetailsService(): Provides a UserDetailsService bean, which is used to load user-specific data. It retrieves user details from the database using the UserRepository. If the user is not found, it throws a UsernameNotFoundException.

authenticationProvider(): Configures an AuthenticationProvider, which uses the UserDetailsService to authenticate users and the PasswordEncoder to validate passwords. This provider is used by Spring Security to check user credentials during login.

authenticationManager(AuthenticationConfiguration config): Provides an AuthenticationManager bean. The AuthenticationManager is used to authenticate users by delegating to the AuthenticationProvider.

passwordEncoder(): Provides a PasswordEncoder bean, specifically a BCryptPasswordEncoder. This encoder is used to hash and check passwords securely.

How They Work Together
User Login:

When a user tries to log in, the AuthenticationManager from the ApplicationConfig class handles the authentication request.
The AuthenticationProvider is used by the AuthenticationManager to authenticate the user. It delegates the user details retrieval to the UserDetailsService and checks the password using the PasswordEncoder.
Generating JWT:

Once a user is authenticated, the application can generate a JWT token using the JwtService class. The generateToken method creates a token that includes user details and an expiration date.
Validating JWT:

When a user makes a request with a JWT token, the JwtService class is used to validate the token. It checks if the token is expired and if it matches the user details.
Example Flow
User Login:

User submits username and password.
AuthenticationManager uses DaoAuthenticationProvider to validate credentials.
If successful, a JWT token is generated by JwtService and returned to the user.
User Makes a Request:

User includes the JWT token in the request header.
JwtService verifies the tokenâ€™s validity, extracts claims, and allows access to protected resources if the token is valid.
By connecting these components, your application ensures secure user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
